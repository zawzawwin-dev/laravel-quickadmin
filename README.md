# Laravel Starter (based on Laravel 10.x)
**Laravel Starter** is a Laravel 10.x based simple starter project. Most of the commonly needed features of an application like `Authentication`, `Authorisation`, `User` and `Role management`, `Application Backend`, `Backup`, `Log viewer` are available here. It is modular, so you may use this project as a base and build your own modules. A module can be used in any `Laravel Starter` based projects. 

Please let me know your feedback and comments.

# Custom Commands

To create a project use the following command, you have repalce the MODULE_NAME with the name of the module.

```

You may want to use `--force` option to overwrite the existing module. if you use this option, it will replace all the exisitng files with the defalut stub files.
